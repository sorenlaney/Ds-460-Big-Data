# Grade Letter Request - Soren Laney

***

## Letter Request 

For the following reasons I request an A- in the class of Big Data Fall 2022. 

### Asignments 

At the beginning of the smester I struggled to learn and understand the material. However, as the smester went on 
I worked extremely hard to not only understand the material, but excel at it. I re-submitted all of the coding challenges that I
did not recieve a 4 on and with the exception of **Unit of Analysis and Easy Feature Challengeamd** and  the **Pyspark Coding Challenge** I recieved 
a 4 on every other assignment. I also believe that I will recieve a 3 or above on the final app coding challenge because I have completed 
all but two of the requirements. However, I do realize that I was slower in understanding and completing the assignments with a passing grade. 

### Hours Requirement

Over the course of the semester I put in a total of 153 hours into thius class. In the beginning of the semester I put a lot of hours into 
learning pyspark. I found and acquired a a pyspark big data course from Udemny which I completed. It covered everything from setting a virtual
enviroment for pyspark to spark data frames and mllib. I also spent a lot of time at the end of the semester working on the group projects that I 
was the main if not the main contributor on.

### Involvement

I was involved in all class periods that I attended, and did not miss any classes this semester. 

### Impact

the 3) streamlit app presentation. I designed and put together most of the repositroies in github, cordinating with the team group meetings and completed
a lot of the project work.
