# Grade Letter Request - Soren Laney
***

### What you liked and didn't like about the course.

  The course coverd a wide area of materials and taught pratical deployment of data sicenece tools. This was really impressive
  and something that I particualry liked about the course. I didn't particuarly always like how the class was so loosely taught and 
  meant to be so self directed. However. I will admit that under a lighter course load it would have been easier to spend more time figuring out what needs 
  to be done to be successful in the class. 

### Recommendations for improvement.

  I think the biggest improvement to the course would be a coding assigment that covers the majority of the functions that would be neeeded in pyspark
  for this course. The other assignment that I would add would be one that preps students understanding of the data for the course of that semester
  that they will need to complete the rest of the assigments for the semester. Of sourse, these are the areas that I struggled in the most, so it might 
  not be the most advantageous to other students to spend time on these areas.

## Letter Request 

For the following reasons I request an A- in the class of Big Data Fall 2022. 

### Asignments 

At the beginning of the smester I struggled to learn and understand the material. However, as the smester went on 
I worked extremely hard to not only understand the material, but excel at it. I re-submitted all of the coding challenges that I
did not recieve a 4 on and with the exception of **Unit of Analysis and Easy Feature Challengeamd** and  the **Pyspark Coding Challenge** I recieved 
a 4 on every other assignment. I also believe that I will recieve a 3 or above on the final app coding challenge because I have completed 
all but two of the requirements. However, I do realize that I was slower in understanding and completing the assignments with a passing grade. 

### Hours Requirement

Over the course of the semester I put in a total of 153 hours into thius class. In the beginning of the semester I put a lot of hours into 
learning pyspark. I found and acquired a a pyspark big data course from Udemny which I completed. It covered everything from setting a virtual
enviroment for pyspark to spark data frames and mllib. I also spent a lot of time at the end of the semester working on the group projects that I 
was the main if not the main contributor on.

|Programming and Project Work          | 114.66      | 
|Programming and Project Work          | 32.91       |
|Programming and Project Work          | 5.57        | 
|**Total**                             | **153.14**	 |

### Involvement

I was involved in all class periods that I attended, and did not miss any classes this semester. 

### Impact

I was heavily involved in all projects and I bekieve that I was the main contributor on the 1) Second Feature challenge, the 2) Machine Learning challenge, and 
the 3) streamlit app presentation. I designed and put together most of the repositroies in github, cordinating with the team group meetings and completed
a lot of the project work.
